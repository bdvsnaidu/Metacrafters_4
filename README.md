# ASSESSMENT-4
Creating a smart contract with 2 or 3 functions and integrating it with the front end.

# Description
We will be building a smart contract with some functions and integrating it with the front-end part. So we can make the changes required with the help of the icons present in the frontend application so that it will be connected with the backend (meta mask wallet). The basic idea is that in the frontend we will be importing Web3 and establishing a connection with the Ethereum network. For this project, we will install some different software like Node js and Metamask. Node js is a javascript runtime environment and library for running web applications. Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The main thing to establish a connection with the front end is the Contract address and the ABI (application binary interface). We added an extra function which is the calculator, which performs operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.


# Getting started

Features of the frontend application:
1. Deposit ETH into the atm
2. Withdraw ETH from the atm
3. Add the two values A and B
4. Subtract the two values from A and B
5. Multiply the two values A and B


Customization

You can customize the UI elements, styles, and behavior of the Crypto ATM component according to your project's requirements. Modify the JSX structure, CSS styles, and event handlers to align with your application's design and functionality.


# Setup
After cloning GitHub, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
Open two additional terminals in your VS code
In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front end.
After this, the project will be running on your local host. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
